# Hostel Management System

## Introduction
Hostel Management System (HMS) is an interactive software, which is used to manage many activities that are being done in a hostel such as a student’s IN&OUT records, monthly mess information, daily attendance, notifications, etc. Since the number of educational institutions has been increasing rapidly, the number of hostels also increased. And hence there is a lot of strain on the person who is running the hostel and software’s not usually used in this context. This particular project deals with the problems of managing a hostel and avoids the problems which occur when carried out manually.

##  About
The current repo consists of the frontend part of hostel management system.
